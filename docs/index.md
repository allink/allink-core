# Introduction

This documentary specifies the way allink-core is ment to be used. It will also give some usefull tips on how to get started. It will not however cover the technical details of its underliing codebase.
allink-core is ment to be used with our boilerplate project which is hosted on the [divio cloud](https://www.divio.com/en/). (feel free to send us a [message](mailto:itcrowd@allink.ch) if you would like to have a look.)

The steps we describe here are mostly closly coupled to our setup and environment. So the described steps might not make sense to you, when you don't know our setup. Also we skip steps which we already included in the boilerplate.
