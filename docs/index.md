# Introduction
allink-core is a heavily opinionated collection of django apps, django-cms plugins and other utilities. allink-core was implemented to create a standardized ecosystem for django-cms projects developed at [allink AG](https://www.allink.ch). 

allink-core is ment to be used with our boilerplate project which is hosted on the [divio cloud](https://www.divio.com/en/). (feel free to send us a [message](mailto:itcrowd@allink.ch) if you would like to have a look.)
The steps we describe here are mostly closely coupled to our setup and environment. So the described steps might not make sense to you, when you don't know our setup. Also we skip steps which we already included in the boilerplate.
