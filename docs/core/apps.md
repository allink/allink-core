# Information

All modules in <code>apps</code> are considered standard apps which we have implemented on several projects and want to reuse when possible in upcoming projects. However every project has its own requirements and therefore all the components of these apps can be overriden in customer projects. (See [fork_app](../client/fork_app.md).)

!!! note
    We refer to them as 'allink apps'.


At the moment not every app is documented in this guide. For reference please see [code base](https://github.com/allink/allink-core/tree/v1.0.x/allink_core/apps).
