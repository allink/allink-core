# Working with "Read the Docs"

Install MkDocs globally
```
sudo pip install mkdocs
```
Navigate into project and run:
```
mkdocs serve
```

This will run a buil-in-dev-server on "http://127.0.0.1:8000" where you can preview the doc. More Information on [mkdocs.org](http://www.mkdocs.org/) or [mkdocs rtd](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
